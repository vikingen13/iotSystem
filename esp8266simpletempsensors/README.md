The software embedded in the board is developped using Micro Python.

The firmware used in this project is the [v1.19.1 (2022-06-18)](https://micropython.org/resources/firmware/esp8266-20220618-v1.19.1.bin) available on the [Micron Python](https://micropython.org/download/esp8266/) web page.

To flash your board and to copy files, you can follow the process [here](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/flashing-micropython-firmware-esptool-py-esp32-esp8266/).

The [thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/) is also convenient to interact with the board.
